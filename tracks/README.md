## Talentmine Tracks
It's great to see you here! We are really excited that you want to become a contributor at Talentmine. Thank you!

#### What are Tracks?
Talentmine Tracks are collection of curated resources organised in a easy to follow manner to help people learn a particular skill. We aim to create one stop shop for community driven learning portal for in-demand tech skills.

A track is a collection of courses. A course is bite-sized content for learning a particular concept. A course could be an article, list of articles, videos, podcast or a combination of all three.

#### Code of Conduct / How to Contribute

- The first step is to fork this repository
- Create a new directory for the new track in the tracks directory e.g `frontend-development`
- Create a `README.md` file inside the new track directory. The README file should contain the overview of the track and a "What you will learn section".
- Proceed to create the first course
    - A course should be created in a markdown file. Each markdown file should follow the convention `n-<title-of-the-course>` where n is the index of the course. For example, `1-what-is-frontend-development.md` can be the first course in the `frontend-development` track.
    - Each course should have a maximum of 5 different resources. We recommend you create a new course if a concept would require more 5 learning resources.
    - Each resource could either be an article or video or book you created by you or someone else. A learning resource should be one that you highly recommend for a learner - someone who is probably new to the field. 

- We want to keep each track as succinct as possible a track should have a maximum of 10 courses.
- To contribute to an existing track, simply create branch off the main branch to add your changes. Create a pull request to get your changes merged.
